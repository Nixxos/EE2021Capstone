Subsystems:
	Drivetrain
	Arm
		motors
		encoders
		lidar?
		color?
	Lower lidar array (navigation) 
	Upper lidar array (anti-moving ghost)
	Bump Sensors

Commands:
	Drive(Direction, Distance)
		Direction: cardinal heading (0,1,2,3)
		Distance: Distance in inches to travel
		Direction and distance will be maintained by individual PID loops
	Arm(Position)
		Position: Predefine up, mid and down positions based on encoder values
		Actual aiming will not be done by this, this function is to alter arm main state
	KillGhost:
		Bot should navigate to the ghost using Navigate, then kill should remove the target ghost from it's gridsquare
	Navigate(cur pos, target pos)
		label individual locations on the board and optimize routes between them
	InterruptMovingGhost:
		Maintaining where the bot is on the board, navigate to avoid the moving ghost
